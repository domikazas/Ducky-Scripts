REM (WARNING THIS REM IS BORING SO YOU DONT NEED TO REED IT!!!)                                       so this script is a one inspired by one guy from GitHub I just upgraded it - added that it will set the volume up if the person you're pranking has his  volume off and I added so it will hide after the command runs bc you don't want it to be obvious that you're prankin' then I added some more delays and more text.

REM Description: this script will prank someone by speaking a message to that targets computer about how your car blah blah blah you can just see in the string for yourself:)
